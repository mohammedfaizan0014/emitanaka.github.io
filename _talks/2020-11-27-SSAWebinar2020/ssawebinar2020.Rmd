Statistics is a valuable tool for almost all scientific fields and industry to make sense of their data, yet as a field we lag behind to remain relevant, getting superseded by the so-called data science. What differentiates statistics from data science? And how does the design of experiments fit in with data science?

In this webinar, I will talk about the concept of the "grammar" and the momentum it is gaining to make data analysis more accessible to a diverse group. I'll then present my prototype to the "grammar of experimental design" - a framework to construct the design of comparative experiments that cognitively enforces the experimental structure. I'll explain some principles behind this prototype, showcase how my developmental R-package edibble will work, and how I think it helps to bridge the gap between experimental design theory and practice for the wider community.
