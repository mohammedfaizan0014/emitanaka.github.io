Ideally you want to know to how the data were collected before delving into the analysis of the data; better yet, get involved _before_ the collection of data and design its collection.

This sentiment is often captured in the expression “garbage in, garbage out”. It’s something we all seem to know but there is still a tendency for many of us to place a greater focus on the analysis1. This is perhaps all natural given that a potential for discovery is just so much more exciting than ensuring the quality of the collected data.\nSo what is considered as good quality data? A lack of error in the data? Data containing enough range of variables and sample size for the downstream analysis? Giving an explicit definition of a good quality data is a fraught exercise, but if you know how the data were collected then you can better perform the initial data analysis (Chatfield 1985) to weed out (or fix) potential poor quality data. This step will likely get more value out of the data than fitting complex models to poor quality data.\nBetter than knowing how the data were collected, if you can design the collection of data so that it’s optimised for the purpose of the analysis2, then you can potentially get even a better value out of your data. Not all data collection starts with an explicit analytical plan though. Furthermore, you may have very little control of how the data are collected. Often these are observational data or making a secondary use of experimental data. This article will focus on data collection of an experiment where you have some control of the collection process.\nExperimental data\nAll experiments are conducted with some objective in mind. This could be that a scientist may wish to test their hypothesis, a manufacturer wants to know which manufacturing process is better or a researcher wants to understand some cause-and-effect relationships. A characteristic part of an experiment is that the experimenter has control over some explanatory variables. In a comparative experiment, the control is over the allocation of treatments to subjects. Designing an experiment in the statistics discipline usually focus on this allocation, although it’s important to keep in mind that there are other decision factors in an experiment.\nData that are collected from experiments are what we refer to as experimental data. Because it was collected with some objective in mind followed by some data collection plan, experimental data are often thought of to be better quality than observational data. But then again if you can’t quantify the quality of data, you can’t really tell. Certain scientific claims (e.g. causation, better treatment) can only be substantiated by experiments and so experimental data is held to a higher standard in general.\nDesign and analysis of experiments\n\n\n\ndat_DoE <- read_html(\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ExperimentalDesign.html\")\ndate_download <- Sys.Date()\ncran_names <- available.packages() %>% \n  rownames() %>% \n  unique() # it should be unique\ndoe_pkgs <- dat_DoE %>% \n  html_nodes(\"li\") %>% \n  html_nodes(\"a\") %>% \n  html_text() %>% \n  .[. %in% cran_names] %>% \n  unique()\n\ndat_survey <- read_html(\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/OfficialStatistics.html\")\nsurvey_pkgs <- dat_survey %>% \n  html_nodes(\"li\") %>% \n  html_nodes(\"a\") %>% \n  html_text() %>% \n  .[. %in% cran_names] %>% \n  unique()\n\n\n\n\nThere are all together 113 R-packages in the CRAN Task View of Design of Experiments & Analysis of Experimental Data as of 2021-02-07.3 I’m going to refer these packages as DoE packages, although there are some packages in the mix that are more about the analysis of experimental data rather than the design of experiments and there are some packages that are missing in the list (e.g. DeclareDesign). The DoE packages make up about 0.7% of the 17,036 packages available in CRAN.\nThe DoE packages don’t include survey design. These instead belong to the CRAN Task View of Official Statistics & Survey Methodology which contains 132 packages. While some surveys are part of an experimental study, most often they generate observational data.\nBelow I have a number of different analysis for these DoE packages. If you push the button on the top right corner of this article, you can toggle the display for the code or alternatively you can have a look at the source Rmd document.\nBigram of DoE package titles and descriptions\n\n\n\nstop_words_ext <- c(stop_words$word, \"doi\")\n\ndoe_db <- db %>% \n  filter(Package %in% doe_pkgs) %>% \n  mutate(Description = str_replace_all(Description, \"\\n\", \" \"),\n         Description = str_squish(Description),\n         Title = str_replace_all(Title, \"\\n\", \" \"))\n\nbigram_tab <- function(data, col) {\n  data %>% \n    unnest_tokens(word, {{col}}, token = \"ngrams\", n = 2) %>% \n    separate(word, c(\"word1\", \"word2\"), sep = \" \") %>% \n    mutate(word1 = singularize(word1),\n           word2 = singularize(word2)) %>% \n    # don't count the same bigram within the same package\n    distinct(Package, word1, word2) %>% \n    filter(!word1 %in% stop_words_ext,\n           !word2 %in% stop_words_ext,\n           !str_detect(word1, \"^[0-9.]+$\"),\n           !str_detect(word2, \"^[0-9.]+$\")) %>% \n    count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbigram_tab(doe_db, Description) %>% \n  filter(n > 4) %>% \n  mutate(word = paste(word1, word2)) %>% \n  select(word, n) %>% \n  kbl(caption = \"The bigram of the R-package _descriptions_ as provided in the DESCRIPTION file in CRAN.\", \n               col.names = c(\"Bigram\", \"Count\")) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbigram_tab(doe_db, Title) %>% \n  filter(n > 3) %>% \n  mutate(word = paste(word1, word2)) %>% \n  select(word, n) %>% \n  kbl(caption = \"The bigram of the R-package _titles_ as provided in the DESCRIPTION file in CRAN.\", \n               col.names = c(\"Bigram\", \"Count\")) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows the most common bigrams in the title of the DoE packages. It’s perhaps not surprising but the words “optimal design” and “experimental design” are the top. It’s also likely that the words “design of experiments” appears often but because this is a bigram (two consecutive words) so it doesn’t appear. You might then wonder if that’s the case words like “design of” or “of experiments” should make an appearance, however “of” is a stop word and these are filtered out otherwise unwanted bigrams come up on the top.\nThere are couple of words like “clinical trial” and “dose finding” that suggests applications in medical experiments, as well as “microarray experiment” that suggests application in bioinformatics.\n\n\nTable 1: The bigram of the R-package titles as provided in the DESCRIPTION file in CRAN.\n\n\nBigram\n\n\nCount\n\n\noptimal design\n\n\n10\n\n\nexperimental design\n\n\n8\n\n\nclinical trial\n\n\n5\n\n\ndose finding\n\n\n5\n\n\nsequential design\n\n\n5\n\n\nblock design\n\n\n4\n\n\nmicroarray experiment\n\n\n4\n\n\nresponse surface\n\n\n4\n\n\nThe title alone might be too succinct for text analysis so I also had a look at the most common bigrams in the description of the DoE packages as shown in Table 2. The counts in Table 2 (and also Table 1) is across the DoE packages. To be more clear, even if the bigram is mentioned multiple times within the description, it’s only counted once per package. This removes the inflation of the counts due to one package mentioning the same bigram over and over again.\nAgain not surprisingly “experimental design” and “optimal design” comes on top in the DoE package descriptions. The words “graphical user” and “user interface” implies that the trigram “graphical user interface” was probably common.\n\n\nTable 2: The bigram of the R-package descriptions as provided in the DESCRIPTION file in CRAN.\n\n\nBigram\n\n\nCount\n\n\nexperimental design\n\n\n11\n\n\noptimal design\n\n\n10\n\n\npackage provide\n\n\n7\n\n\nresponse surface\n\n\n7\n\n\nfactorial design\n\n\n6\n\n\ngraphical user\n\n\n6\n\n\nuser interface\n\n\n6\n\n\nblock design\n\n\n5\n\n\ncontour plot\n\n\n5\n\n\ndesign based\n\n\n5\n\n\neffect model\n\n\n5\n\n\nfractional factorial\n\n\n5\n\n\nmicroarray experiment\n\n\n5\n\n\nmixed effect\n\n\n5\n\n\nprovide function\n\n\n5\n\n\nsample size\n\n\n5\n\n\nsequential design\n\n\n5\n\n\nNetwork of DoE package imports and dependencies\n\n\n\ndoe_imports <- doe_db %>% \n  mutate(Depends = str_replace_all(Depends, \"\\n\", \" \"),\n         Depends = str_replace_all(Depends, fixed(\"(\"), \" (\"),\n         Imports = str_replace_all(Imports, \"\\n\", \" \"),\n         Imports = str_replace_all(Imports, fixed(\"(\"), \" (\"),\n         imports = str_c(Depends, Imports, sep = \",\"),\n         imports = str_split(imports, \",\"),\n         imports = map(imports, ~{\n                    str_squish(.x) %>% \n                      word() %>% \n                      .[.!=\"\"]}\n           ),\n         imports_doe = map(imports, ~.x[.x %in% doe_pkgs])) %>% \n  select(Package, imports_doe) %>% \n  unnest_longer(imports_doe) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(imports_doe)) %>% \n  rename(from = imports_doe, to = Package) %>% \n  select(from, to)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the imports and dependency between the DoE packages. We can see here that DoE.wrapper imports a fair number of DoE packages that results in the major network cluster see in Figure 1. AlgDesign and DoE.base are imported into four other DoE packages so form an important base in the DoE world.\n\n\n\ngraph_from_data_frame(doe_imports) %>% \n  ggraph(layout = 'fr') +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(start_cap = label_rect(node1.name),\n                     end_cap = label_rect(node2.name)), \n                 arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, 'mm')),\n                 color = \"#79003e\") + \n  geom_node_text(aes(label = name),\n                 color = \"#79003e\") +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f6e5ee\",\n                                        color = \"#79003e\"),\n        plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The network of imports and dependency among DoE packages alone. Each node represents a DoE package. DoE packages with no imports or dependency on other DoE packages are excluded. Each arrow represents the relationship between the packages such that the package on the tail is used by package on the head of the arrow.\n\n\n\nCRAN download logs\n\n\n\nend <- Sys.Date() - 2 # usually 1-2 days are not available yet\nstart <- end - years(5) + days(2)\ndldat <- cran_downloads(doe_pkgs, from = start, to = end)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndldat %>% \n    group_by(package) %>% \n    summarise(total = sum(count)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(total)) + \n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"#AD0059\") + \n  scale_x_log10(label = comma) + \n  myggtheme + \n  labs(x = glue(\"Total download counts from {start} to {end}\"),\n       y = \"Number of packages\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the total download counts over the last 5 years4 of the DoE packages. This graph doesn’t take into account that some DoE packages may only have been on CRAN in the last 5 years so the counts are in favour of DoE packages that’s been on CRAN longer.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Histogram of the total download count over last 5 years of the DoE packages.\n\n\n\nTop 5 DoE packages\n\n\n\nntop <- 5\n\ntop5sum_df <- dldat %>% \n  group_by(package) %>% \n  summarise(total = sum(count)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  slice_max(order_by = total, n = ntop)\n\ntop5 <- top5sum_df %>% \n  pull(package) \n\ntop5_df <- dldat %>% \n  filter(package %in% top5) %>% \n  mutate(package = fct_reorder(package, count, function(x) -sum(x))) \n\n\n\n\nThe top 5 downloaded DoE packages at the time of this writing are AlgDesign, agricolae, lhs, ez, and DoE.base. You can see the download counts in Figure 3.\n\n\n\ntop5sum_df %>% \n  mutate(package = fct_reorder(package, total)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(total, package)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = package)) +\n  labs(x = glue(\"Total downloads from {start} to {end}\"),\n       y = \"Package\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma, expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  myggtheme + \n  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(rev = TRUE) + \n  guides(fill = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The above barplot shows the total downloads of the top 5 downloaded DoE packages from the period 2016-02-07 to 2021-02-05.\n\n\n\nWe can have a look at further examination of the top 5 DoE packages by looking at the daily download counts as shown in Figure 3. The download counts are the raw values and these include downloads by CRAN mirror and bots. There is a noticeable spike when there is an update to the CRAN package. This is partly because when there is a new version of the package, when you install other packages that depend or import it then R will prompt you to install the new version. This means that the download counts are inflated and to some extent you can artificially boost them by making regular CRAN updates. The adjustedcranlogs (Morgan-Wall 2017) makes a nice attempt to adjust the raw counts based on a certain heuristic. I didn’t use it since the adjustment is stochastic and I appear to have hit a bug.\n\n\n\npkg_url <- \"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{pkg}/index.html\"\npkg_archive <- \"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/{pkg}/\"\npkg_updates <- map(top5, function(pkg) {\n    last_update <- read_html(glue(pkg_url)) %>% \n      html_table() %>% \n      .[[1]] %>% \n      filter(X1==\"Published:\") %>% \n      pull(X2) %>% \n      ymd()\n      \n    archive_dates <- tryCatch({ \n        read_html(glue(pkg_archive)) %>% \n          html_table() %>%\n          .[[1]] %>% \n          pull(`Last modified`) %>% \n          ymd_hm() %>% \n          na.omit() %>% \n          as.Date()\n      }, error = function(e) {\n        NULL\n      })\n    c(archive_dates, last_update)\n  })\nnames(pkg_updates) <- top5\n\nupdates <- unlist(pkg_updates) %>% \n  enframe(\"package\", \"update\") %>% \n  # unlist converts date to integers\n  mutate(update = as.Date(update, origin = \"1970-01-01\"),\n         # need to get rid of the numbers appended to pkg names\n         package = str_extract(package, paste0(top5, collapse=\"|\")),\n         package = factor(package, levels = top5)) %>% \n  filter(between(update, start, end))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(top5_df, aes(date, count, color = package)) +\n  # add shadow lines\n  geom_line(data = rename(top5_df, package2 = package), \n            color = \"gray\", aes(group = package2)) +\n  # add date when package was updated\n  geom_vline(data = updates, aes(xintercept = update),\n             linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"#79003e\") + \n  # the trend line\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_log10() +\n  facet_grid(package ~ .) + \n  labs(title = glue(\"Top 5 downloaded DoE packages from {start} to {end}\")) + \n  scale_color_discrete_qualitative() +\n  guides(color = FALSE) +\n  myggtheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The above plot shows the daily downloads of the top 5 downloaded DoE packages from the period 2016-02-07 to 2021-02-05.

Bob Wheeler doesn’t seem to actively contribute to AlgDesign any longer; and there are two contributors for DoE.base but are not listed as authors.\nBefore we look at the packages, let’s set a seed so we can reproduce the results.\n\n\nset.seed(2021)\n\n\n\nAlgDesign\nTo start off, we begin with the most downloaded DoE package, AlgDesign.

The API of the packages are quite distinct. The object that it outputs can vary from a matrix to a list. DoE might be a dull area for many but it’s quite important for the downstream analysis. Perhaps if many of us talk more about it, it may help invigorate the area!\n\n\nfunction showscript() {\n  var x = document.getElementsByClassName('toggle-code');\n  var n = x.length;\n  for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    var e = x[i];\n    if (e.style.display == \"block\") {\n      e.style.display = \"none\";\n    } else {\n      e.style.display = \"block\";\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCarnell, Rob. 2020.

The analytical focus is reflected also in the R packages; there are 1,779 R-packages on CRAN with the word “analysis” in the title as opposed to 257 R-packages with the word “design” in its title.↩︎\nKeeping in mind though that your analysis plan may change once you actually have collected data. This is quite common in the analysis of plant breeding trials since some spatial variation only become apparent only after the data collection.↩︎\nI originally had a webscrapping error where I didn’t remove duplicate entries so numbers presented at TokyoR and SSA Webinar had the wrong numbers.↩︎\nAs of 2021-02-07.↩︎\n",

One of the standards for drawing this is using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) managed by the Object Management Group (OMG).\nUML was developed in the field of software engineering to provide a standard way to visualise the design of a system. It’s a language that describes standards for all sorts of diagrams, not just the sequence diagram, e.g. communication diagram, interaction overview diagram and so on.\nThe interaction of actors with the system depicted as objects with passage of time depicted as a vertical dotted line (a.k.a. lifeline) seemed like a good fit to use for illustrating the concept of edibble.\nOmnigraffle\nI always find drawing complicated diagrams to be tricky via programming so I initially drew the diagram using OmniGraffle. There were some UML stencils and I thought it was going well (result in Figure 1). Aligning the objects as a sequence diagram, even with OmniGraffle’s precise object placement, was a bit difficult but it got the job done in the end.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Drawn using OmniGraffle\n\n\n\nThen I wanted to change and reorder some elements of the diagram. It’s already taken me half a day to make a Figure 1, I really didn’t want to repeat the process. Surely, there must be another tool that will make this easier?\nOnline tools\nAnd thus began my journey (and what felt like a rabbit hole) in finding other tools to draw a sequence diagram. I found several online mapping solutions including Lucidchart and Visual Paradigm but it wasn’t what I was after. Eventually I came across GitMind. It was the most promising to me: it has a nice user interface, the features that I want and it happened to be completely free! It was easier than OmniGraffle to make sequence diagrams. You can find the result of the drawing in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Drawn using GitMind.\n\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the font for the PDF version is not rendered correctly. This is perhaps I’ve chosen a font available only in my system (“Fira Code”).\nOkay, looks like I’m good with this. Let’s use this in the edibble documentation… Wait the interaction between the statisitican and Design doesn’t fit the narrative well, I need to modify the diagram again!\nThis was a point when I realise I really need to programmatically create the diagram. Being somewhat of an anti click-and-point statistical software, I should have perhaps pursued the programmatic route earlier.\nR\nThe most comprehensive R-package to draw a diagram is DiagrammeR. When you go to the website (which has an impressively interface) it has the tagline “Sometimes You Want To Create Nice Diagrams: WHY NOT DO THAT WITH R?”. That’s a good question to ask past Emi.\nDiagrammeR\nUnder the hood, DiagrammeR it’s powered by Graphviz and mermaid. Sequence diagrams are supported by mermaid but there seems to be no distinguishment between an actor and an object. It seems like you always have to a message when actor/object is interacting.\n\n\nDiagrammeR::mermaid(\"\nsequenceDiagram\n    domain expert->>statistician: consult\n    statistician-->>domain expert: query\n    statistician->>Design: start_design()\n    statistician->>Design: set_units()\")\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    domain expert->>statistician: consult\\n    statistician-->>domain expert: query\\n    statistician->>Design: start_design()\\n    statistician->>Design: set_units()\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nFigure 3: Drawn using mermaid via DiagrammeR\n\n\n\nIt’s fairly good and you can further customise the look using CSS, but it doesn’t have the actor symbol and some other standard UML symbols, it will be too much effort by me to recreate what I made using GitMind.\nnomnoml\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Drawn using nomnoml.com\n\n\n\nThe nomnoml R-package describes itself as a Sassy UML Diagrams for R. It’s powered by the nomnoml tool which has a nice simple website to create the diagrams you want. I quite enjoy using the website version where the graph renders instantenously using a simple syntax. The graph made using the web (Figure 4) is different to the one produced via R shown below along with the nomnoml syntax.\n\n[<actor>domain expert] -- [<hidden> fin1]\n[<actor>statistician] -- [<hidden> fin2]\n[design] -- [<end> end]\n[<database> data] -- [<hidden> hid]\n[<actor>technician] -- [<hidden> fin3]\n\n{\"x\":{\"code\":\"\\n#fill: #FEFEFF\\n#lineWidth: 1\\n#zoom: 4\\n#direction: right\\n\\n[<actor>domain expert] -- [<hidden> fin1]\\n[<actor>statistician] -- [<hidden> fin2]\\n[design] -- [<end> end]\\n[<database> data] -- [<hidden> hid]\\n[<actor>technician] -- [<hidden> fin3]\",\"svg\":false},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nIt turns out thought that the nomnoml doesn’t support sequence diagrams and it doesn’t look like it will support it any time either.\nplantuml\nI came across another R-package for UML diagrams called plantuml. It’s powered by the the plantUML tool which has a extensive support for a sequence diagram (yes!).\nThis one is not on CRAN yet. I initially had trouble getting it to work but managed to work re-installing GraphViz. I could get the example code to work but the code for sequence diagram didn’t work for me so I used the online version of plantUML directly.\nI expanded a lot more than previous graphs with plantUML code below. The problem I realise now is that the image has become too big and too much text to be concise. So I’ll have to tweak some more (when does this end?). At least now making an adjustment isn’t hard this time!\n@startuml\nactor \"domain expert\" as expert #fff\nactor statistician as stat #AD0059\nparticipant design as design #fff\ndatabase data as data #fff\nactor technician as tech #fff\n== Conceptualizing the experiment ==\ngroup Consultation\nexpert -> stat: I want to test which wheat variety is best\nstat -> design: library(edibble)\\nstart_design(name = \"wheat\")\nactivate design\nstat -> design: set_context(aim = \"identify best variety\")\nstat -> expert: What varieties are you testing?\nexpert -->> stat: I'm testing Mace and RockStar\nstat -> design: set_trts(var = c(\"Mace\", \"RockStar\"))\nexpert -->> stat: I have a field with 20 plots each at Narrabri and\\n10 plots at Roseworthy that I can use for testing\nstat -> design: set_units(site = c(\"Narrabri\", \"Roseworthy\"),\\n.               plot = nested_in( site,\\n                                    \"Narrabri\" ~ 20,\\n                              \"Roseworthy\" ~ 10))\nstat -> expert: What do you consider as \"best\"?\nexpert -> stat: For now, I just want to select one that'll give me\\nthe highest yield.\nstat -> design: set_rcrds(yield = plot)\nstat -> expert: What's range of values do you expect for the yield?\nexpert -->> stat: Well it never goes over 10 tonnes per hectre in my fields!\nstat -> design: expect_rcrds(yield = to_be_numeric( with_value( between = c(0, 10))))\nstat -> expert: Do you have any restrictions in allocation of varieties at site or plots?\nexpert -->> stat: No.\nstat -> design: allocate_trts(var ~ plot)\nstat -> design: plot()\ndesign -->> stat\nstat -> expert: Well, this is my current understanding of the structure.\\nHave I understood it correctly?\nexpert -->> stat: That looks right.\nstat -->> expert: Okay I'll send the design when it's ready.\nend \nstat -> design: **randomise_trts()**\nstat -> design: serve_table()\ndesign -> data: export_design()\nactivate data\ndeactivate design\nstat -> design !!: end session\nexpert -> data: inspect\ntech -> data: inquire\ntech -> data: data entry\ngroup opt [invalid entry]\ndata -->> tech: error\nend\n== Import data and analyse==\n@enduml\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Drawn using plantUML\n\n\n\nIn the end the solution wasn’t quite R, but perhaps it will be when the plantuml package upgrades or other solutions are developed.\n\n\n\n",

It took longer than what I had hoped to get the hexagon shape right. You may like to save your own time by downloading my powerpoint template here as a base to make your own.\nThe dimensions were set, as it is in hexSticker, so that you can print it according to http://hexb.in/sticker.html.\nUsing copyright images in hex stickers\nIt’s worth noting about copyright of images since you may like to use images in your hex sticker. If you created the image on your own then the copyright in general will rest with you and there is no problem. If you borrow images from others, you may need to provide attribution depending on their license permission.\nIn hex stickers, you don’t really have a room to add citations so you may like to use those that require no attribution. For free ones, you can find these using sites such as flickr under Public Domain works (CC0).\nIt is a bit painful to consider copyright issues but it is important to give due credit, acknowledgement, attribution etc to the creator of the work. I’ve gone to great lengths at times to search for CC0 images or have paid for work. Afterall, creative work is valuable and should be properly rewarded.\nUPDATE 22/06 My sticker arrived! They are pretty good quality! I also got 16 which is more than the 10 sample they said on the website \n\nThese are from sticker mule. If you sign up with referral code here, both you and I will get some credit. You are, of course, welcomed to just go directly to the site to make the purchase.\n\n\n\n\n",
